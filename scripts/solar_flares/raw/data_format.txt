   1- 2   I2    Data code; always 31.
   3- 5   I3    Station code, 777 for GOES
   6- 7   I2    Year
   8- 9   I2    Month
  10-11   I2    Day
  12-13   A2    Asterisks mark record with unconfirmed change.
  14-17   I4    Start time.
                NOTE: If event is correlated to an optical
                flare in data prior to 1997, the event times
                are for the optical event.  For data after 1996,
                these event times WILL BE FOR THE XRAY EVENT ONLY.

     29   A1    N or S for north or south latitude of correlated
                optical flare, if known.
  30-31   I2    Latitude of correlated optical flare, if known.
     32   A1    E or W for east or west central meridian distance
                of correlated optical flare, if known.
  33-34   I2    Central meridian distance of correlated optical
                flare, if known.

                   the 1-8 Angstrom flux attains.*
  61-63   F3.1  X-ray intensity: a number from 1.0 to 9.9 that

  73-80   A8    Remarks: Beginning with January 1997 data,
                the integrated flux from event start to end
                will appear here if available (units = J/m*2).
  81-85   I5    NOAA/USAF sunspot region number.

 *  X-ray classes are classified according to the order of magnitude
of the peak burst intensity (I) measured at the Earth by satellites
in the 0.1 to 0.8 nm band as follows:

        Class              W/m*2                 Ergs/cm*2/s
          B                  I < 10E-6                I < 10E-3
          C         10E-6 <= I < 10E-5       10E-3 <= I < 10E-2
          M         10E-5 <= I < 10E-4       10E-2 <= I < 10E-1
